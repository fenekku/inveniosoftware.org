          <p>
            Invenio is an open source project that was initially developed by CERN.
            The Invenio brand today covers a suite of currently three main products
            developed the Invenio community:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Invenio RDM - a repository/document management platform</li>
            <li>Invenio ILS - an integrated library system</li>
            <li>Invenio Framework v3 - a code library to build large-scale information
             systems such as Invenio RDM and Invenio ILS</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition to the three main products, a larger number of smaller
            generic code libraries are also being maintained for the benefit of
            the open source commuinty independently of Invenio.

      <span class="section-title">History</span>
        <div clas="row">
          <p>
            Originally, Invenio v1, was a software application that acted as both a
            digital repository and an integrated library system based on MARC21. The first
            release of Invenio (named CDSWare back then) was on August 1st, 2002.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2015, Invenio v3 was rewritten from scratch in order to better support
            large-scale research data managmenet use cases as well as take advantage
            of significant developments in open source off-the-shelf solutions which
            didn't exist back in 2002. Invenio v3 also marked the departure from
            MARC21 as the core metadata format, towards a fully JSON-based system
            supporting many different metadata formats and not only MARC21.
          </p>
          <p>
            Invenio v3 further marked the split of Invenio into several separate products
            each focusing on specific use cases, but all based on the same core
            Invenio Framework v3.
          </p>
          <p>
            What about Invenio v2? Please just don't ask (number 2 is always bad right?) ðŸ˜€
